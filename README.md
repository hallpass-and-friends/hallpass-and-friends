- 👋 Hi, I’m @hallpass-and-friends or Rob Banning if meeting in person
- 👀 I’m interested in both backend (asp.net core, "serverless" functions), frontend (Angular, Gatsby, plain Html/Css/Js), and Trello (power ups)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DDD, Docker & Kubernetes, Next.js,  and Scully
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "smart" angular app and Trello power ups. We use "smart" solutions recognize the importance of addressing and integrating the technical, human and organizational components of a solution.
