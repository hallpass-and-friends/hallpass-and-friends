- 👋 Hi, I’m @hallpass-and-friends or Rob Banning if meeting in person
- 👀 I’m interested in both backend (asp.net core, "serverless" functions), frontend (Angular, NextJs, plain Html/Css/Js), and integrations (Trello, Slack, Obsidian)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Electron, Svelte, and Flutter
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "smart" full-stack apps as well as Trello power-ups or other integrations. For us, "smart" solutions are those that recognize the importance of integrating technical, human. and organizational components of any solution. 
- 🦹 My alter ego is [rbanning](https://github.com/rbanning) on Github
- 📫 You can reach me github@hallpassandfriends.com
