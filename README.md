- 👋 Hi, I’m @hallpass-and-friends or Rob Banning if meeting in person
- 👀 I’m interested in both backend (asp.net core, "serverless" functions), frontend (Angular, NextJs, plain Html/Css/Js), and integrations (Trello, Slack, Obsidian)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Electron, DDD, Docker & Kubernetes, Svelte, and Flutter
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "smart" angular apps and Trello power ups. For us, "smart" solutions are those that recognize the importance of integrating technical, human. and organizational components of any solution. 
- 🦹 My alter ego is [rbanning](https://github.com/rbanning) on Github
- 📫 You can reach me github@hallpassandfriends.com
